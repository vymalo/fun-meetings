# Expose a Dockerized App over HTTPS with Nginx

Below is a step‑by‑step guide to put your existing app (packaged in a Docker image) behind an Nginx reverse proxy serving TLS.

## 1. Generate a TLS Certificate

For local/dev you can create a self‑signed cert. In a folder called `ssl/` run:

```bash
mkdir -p ssl && cd ssl

# Generate a 1‑year self‑signed cert for "localhost"
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 \
  -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout server.key \
  -out server.crt \
